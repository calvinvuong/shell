Features:
	Forks and executes commands!
	Parses mutliple commands on one line!
	Redirects using >, <!
	Pipes using | !
	History listing with $history
	NOT guaranteed to regrow hair!

Attempted:
	Tried multiple pipes and redirection in one line -> worked but something else screwed up and it was time to submit so we had to revert to a previous commit
